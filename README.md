## Crappy Bird: A Flappy Bird Clone

### Background

Crappy Bird is a 2D infinite runner inspired by the notorious addicting game of yesteryear; Flappy Bird

### Functionality & MVP  

With this Conway's Game of Life simulator, users will be able to:
In this Flappy Bird Clone, users will be able to:

- [ ] Keep flapping their little wings in order to avoid collisions with obstacles as well as the ground
- [ ] Each obstacle successfully avoid will award the player with a point, with the intent of trying to beat their personal best
- [ ] Pause the game


In addition, this project will include:

- [ ] A modal that will display the score at the end of the game, as well as display the current high score
- [ ] A production README

### Wireframes

This game will consist of a single screen with game board, mouse controls, as well as links to the Github,
and the About The Progammer modal.  A Pause button will always be displayed on the upper right hand corner.


### Architecture and Technologies

This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

- `JavaScript` for game logic
-  `HTML` Canvas elements for effects
- A yet to be determined physics engine
- `Webpack` to bundle js files.


### Implementation Timeline

**Day 1**:  -- Learning --
  Goals for the day:

- Learn how to employ the functionality of vanilla Javascript in a gaming context, as well as research viable physics engines
- Learn the basics of incorporating dynamic sprites and cool sound effects

**Day 2**: -- Implementing Functionality --
  Goals for the day:

- Build out the functionality of an infinite scrolling screen
- Build out the functionality of the main sprite (flying, falling, dying) as well as collision detection
- Build out the functionality for the ever encroaching demise in the form of pipes

**Day 3**: -- Implementing Design --
  Goals for the day:

- Look into parallax backdrops
- Research into replacing stock design with custom graphics
- Incorporate sound efx at relevant events
- Find out how to replace my straight lines with branches
- Find out how to replace the background with a Mario-esque background, or something more fitting, I honestly haven't decided how true of a clone I would like to be


### Bonus features

Really diverge from the pact and use custom sprites, again dependent on how well I can design digitally and if inspiration hits me through at some point during the exercise

- [ ] Make the background Parallax (may have to incorporate a library)
- [ ] Incorporate cute chimp noises when the monkey jumps
